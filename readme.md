# 3. Project Overview

This project analyzes public datasets to identify which surveillance technologies are likely to be used by different types of government agencies. 
We plan to use machine-learning methods to we build a  classification model that predicts the likelihood that an agency uses each technology category based on its type and location.

# 4. Research Questions

(narrow this down as we get closer)

Which surveillance technologies are most commonly used by different agency types?

Can we predict the set of technologies an agency is likely to use?

(maybe this one? Which features (agency type, jurisdiction, etc.) best explain technology usage patterns?)

# 5. Data Description

pull this from what we put on Kaggle before the final submission:

# 6. Methods

(list all steps here before final submit - steps are noted and annotated in the notebook)

# 7. Results

(TBD)

# 8. Limitations

(Scope, Data weakness, missing data? )
